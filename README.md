- He sold the stock for $33.92 per share.
- He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 2 percent of the amount he received for the stock.

## Write a program that displays the following information:
- [ ] The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.
- [ ] The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he bought the stock.
- [ ] The amount that Joe sold the stock for.
- [ ] The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he sold the stock.
